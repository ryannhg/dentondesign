I pride myself on leading by example and getting the most out of my teams. My management style is rooted in trust, respect, and growth across all levels. This approach has brought professional success and helped me forge strong, lasting bonds over the years. \n\nSome of my clients have included UnitedHealthcare, Mazda, USA Basketball, Land O’Lakes, Thomson Reuters, Allstate, Eli Lilly, Skadden, Navigant, Kirkland & Ellis, William Blaire, and West Monroe.\n\nthe design tenets I have carried with me along the way include:\n\n<br>\n\n## Less is lovely\n\n## Details are delightful\n\n## research is required\n\n## collaboration is crucial\n\n## sell a story\n\n<br>\n\nthese ingredients generate an environment where wonderful things can grow.",
