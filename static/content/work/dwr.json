  "richtext": "\n\n\n\n![]()\n\nthis was a passion project that i executed on my own. the design research process included only personal analysis and perspectives. \n\nI don’t feel the current DWR website is an accurate reflection of their brand. i believe a cleaner and more modern aesthetic would better align with the experience one has in the presence of the company’s stores and furniture.\n\nDesign and style can be intimidating to many. The refresh hinges on the idea that everyone has a designer inside of them. DWR empowers customers to show-off their style through background knowledge and high-end products.\n\n![dwr_home](/images/work_dwr_home.jpg)\n\n![dwr_devices](/images/work_dwr_mobileviews.png)\n\n![dwr_lcw_detail](/images/work_dwr_lcwchair.jpg)\n\n![dwr_designers](/images/work_dwr_designers.jpg)\n\n![dwr_menus](/images/work_dwr_menus.png)\n\n![dwr_designsystem](/images/work_dwr_designsystem.jpg)"
