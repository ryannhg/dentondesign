  "description": "an aspirational refresh for a high-end furniture company that brings iconic modern design to the masses",
  "richtext": "<font color=\"#4D4E4C\">\n\nDWR is an iconic brand that sells timeless iconic brands. The current DWR website experience doesn't reflect that claim. a cleaner and more modern aesthetic would better align with the experience one has in the presence of the companyâ€™s stores and products.\n\nSince design and style can be intimidating for many, this refresh hinges on the idea that everyone has a designer inside of them. DWR wants to empower customers to discover and showcase their style through education, expert consultants, and high-end product lines. This experience and campaign delivers on those needs.\n\n</font>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nwebsite\n\n![DWR Mobile](/images/work_dwr_devices.jpg)\n\n![dwr_home](/images/work_dwr_home.jpg)\n\n![dwr_lcw_detail](/images/work_dwr_lcwchair.jpg)\n\n![dwr_designers](/images/work_dwr_designers.jpg)\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\ncampaign\n\n![DWR Tagline](/images/work_dwr_tagline.jpg)\n\n![DWR Poster](/images/work_dwr_billboard.jpg)\n\n![DWR Magazine Spread](/images/work_dwr_magspread.jpg)\n\n![DWR Shirt](/images/work_dwr_tshirt.jpg)\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\ndesign system\n\n![dwr_designsystem](/images/work_dwr_designsystem.svg)\n\n<br>"
