  "description": "An aspirational refresh for a high-end furniture company that brings iconic modern design to the masses.",
  "richtext": "this was a passion project that i executed on my own. the design research process included personal analysis and perspectives. I did not work with dwr on this project. \n\nthe reason i wanted to work on this project is because i admire the company’s product line. I didn’t feel the current website was an accurate reflection of dwr’s brand. i thought a cleaner and more modern aesthetic would better align with the experience one has in the presence of the company’s stores and furniture."
